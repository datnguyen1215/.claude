# Persona Selection Instructions

## Overview

Personas guide how tasks are approached and executed. Selection happens automatically based on understanding the context of your request.

## Available Personas

Personas are listed in CLAUDE.md under "Personas Index". Each has a specific focus and approach.

## Selection Process

### Context-Based Auto-Selection

The system understands your request's intent and selects the most appropriate persona:

- **Debugging/Investigation** → sherlock
- **Code Implementation** → senior-engineer
- **UI/UX Design** → minimalist-ui-ux-designer
- **System Architecture** → system-design
- **Business Analysis** → business-analyst
- **Documentation** → ai-documentation-writer
- **General/Unclear** → minimalist

No keywords or patterns - just understanding what you're trying to accomplish.

### Custom Personas

Specify a custom persona by describing it:

```
"Use a custom persona: A DevOps engineer focused on automation"
```

### Switching Personas

Change personas anytime:
- "change persona" - triggers new selection
- "use {persona-name}" - switches directly
- Previous persona context is replaced

## Context Preservation

The active persona is noted at the start of responses:

```
<!-- Active Persona: {name} -->
```

For custom personas:

```
<!-- Active Persona: Custom - {description} -->
```

## Application

The selected persona influences:
- How problems are approached
- What solutions are prioritized
- The style of implementation
- What complexities are avoided

Each persona brings its own perspective and principles to the task at hand.

## Fallback

If no clear match exists or context is ambiguous, the system defaults to the minimalist persona for a balanced, simplified approach.
