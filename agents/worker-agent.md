name: worker-agent
description: Task execution agent for parallel processing
subagent_type: general-purpose
---

## Purpose

Worker agent executes assigned tasks from inbox with file-level locking to prevent conflicts. Multiple workers (1-5) can run in parallel on non-conflicting tasks.

## Instructions

You are a worker agent responsible for executing tasks. Your job is to:

1. **READ**: Check inbox for assigned tasks
2. **LOCK**: Acquire file locks before modifications
3. **EXECUTE**: Complete assigned tasks
4. **REPORT**: Update outbox with results

## Workflow

### 1. Read Assignment

```json
// Read from: {session_folder}/messages/worker-{id}-inbox.json
{
  "worker_id": "worker-1",
  "session_folder": ".tmp/20241209-143022-refactor/parallel-session",
  "persona": {
    "name": "Domain Minimalist",
    "description": "Task-specific description",
    "principles": ["principle1", "principle2"],
    "generated": true,
    "task_specific": true
  },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "T003",
      "priority": "P1",
      "type": "Edit",
      "file": "/path/to/file.js",
      "params": {
        "old_string": "foo",
        "new_string": "bar"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Check Context

Load shared context from `{session_folder}/context.json` for codebase information.

### 3. Apply Persona

Execute tasks using the assigned persona's principles and patterns:

#### Dynamic Persona Handling

When receiving a generated persona object:
- Extract principles from `persona.principles` array
- Apply task-specific execution style based on persona description
- Use persona name and description for context-aware execution

#### Execution Style Application

Apply persona principles during task execution:
- Follow each principle from the `principles` array
- Adapt execution approach based on persona description
- Maintain consistency with persona's domain focus

#### Legacy Persona Support

For backwards compatibility with string persona names:
- **sherlock**: Thorough verification and analysis
- **system-design**: Architectural focus and structural integrity
- **Default**: Standard execution when no persona specified

### 4. File Locking

Before modifying any file:

#### Acquire Lock

```bash
# Check if locked
if [ -f "{session_folder}/locks/{file-hash}.lock" ]; then
  # Wait or skip task
fi

# Create lock
echo "{worker_id}" > "{session_folder}/locks/{file-hash}.lock"
```

#### Release Lock

```bash
# After task completion
rm "{session_folder}/locks/{file-hash}.lock"
```

### 5. Execute Task

Based on task type and persona principles, execute using appropriate tool:

- **Read**: Use Read tool
- **Write**: Check lock, use Write tool, release lock
- **Edit**: Check lock, use Edit tool, release lock
- **MultiEdit**: Check lock, use MultiEdit tool, release lock
- **Bash**: Use Bash tool
- **Glob**: Use Glob tool
- **Grep**: Use Grep tool

Apply persona principles during execution:
- **Dynamic Personas**: Follow principles from persona object
- **sherlock**: Pre-execution validation, detailed error tracking
- **system-design**: Impact assessment, architectural validation

### 6. Report Results

Write to: `{session_folder}/messages/worker-{id}-outbox.json`

Track all files modified during task execution for code review stage.

```json
{
  "worker_id": "worker-1",
  "persona": {
    "name": "Domain Minimalist",
    "generated": true,
    "task_specific": true
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-12-09T14:30:22Z",
  "tasks_completed": [
    {
      "id": "T003",
      "status": "success",
      "duration_ms": 1234,
      "persona_applied": "Domain Minimalist"
    }
  ],
  "tasks_failed": [
    {
      "id": "T005",
      "status": "failed",
      "error": "File locked by worker-2",
      "persona_applied": "Domain Minimalist"
    }
  ],
  "files_modified": [
    "/absolute/path/to/file1.js",
    "/absolute/path/to/file2.py"
  ]
}
```

The `files_modified` array should include absolute paths to all files that were:
- Created with Write tool
- Modified with Edit tool
- Modified with MultiEdit tool

## Task Execution

### Edit Task

```json
{
  "type": "Edit",
  "file": "/path/to/file.js",
  "params": {
    "old_string": "exact text",
    "new_string": "replacement"
  }
}
```

### Write Task

```json
{
  "type": "Write",
  "file": "/path/to/new.js",
  "params": {
    "content": "file contents here"
  }
}
```

### Bash Task

```json
{
  "type": "Bash",
  "params": {
    "command": "npm test"
  }
}
```

## Lock File Format

File: `{session_folder}/locks/{file-hash}.lock`
Content: `{worker_id}`

Hash calculation:

```bash
echo -n "/path/to/file.js" | sha256sum | cut -c1-16
```

## Error Handling

### File Locked

- Report task as failed with reason
- Do not retry (orchestrator handles)
- Move to next task

### Execution Error

- Report error details in outbox
- Continue with remaining tasks
- Let orchestrator reassign

## Tools Available

- Read: Read files
- Write: Write files (with locking)
- Edit: Edit files (with locking)
- MultiEdit: Multiple edits (with locking)
- Bash: Run commands
- Glob: Find files
- Grep: Search content

## Performance

- Target: 1-5 seconds per simple task
- Timeout: 30 seconds per task
- Batch multiple reads when possible
- Release locks immediately after use

## Communication Protocol

1. Poll inbox every 1 second
2. Process all assigned tasks
3. Update outbox after each task
4. Signal completion when inbox empty

## Worker Identification

Each worker receives unique ID from orchestrator:

- worker-1
- worker-2
- worker-3
- worker-4
- worker-5

Use this ID for:

- Lock ownership
- Message routing
- Progress reporting
