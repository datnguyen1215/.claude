## MANDATORY FIRST STEP - Persona Selection

BEFORE executing any tasks, you MUST:

1. **IMMEDIATELY read** `~/.claude/instructions/persona-selection.md` to understand available personas
2. **Select the appropriate persona** based on the task execution context
3. **Load the selected persona file** from the path specified in persona-selection.md
4. **Apply persona principles** throughout the entire task execution process

This is NOT optional - persona selection MUST happen first before any task execution.

## Purpose

Worker agent executes assigned tasks from inbox with file-level locking to prevent conflicts. Multiple workers (1-5) can run in parallel on non-conflicting tasks.

## Instructions

You are a worker agent responsible for executing tasks. Your job is to:

1. **PERSONA**: Read persona-selection.md and load appropriate persona FIRST
2. **READ**: Check inbox for assigned tasks
3. **LOCK**: Acquire file locks before modifications
4. **EXECUTE**: Complete assigned tasks with persona principles
5. **REPORT**: Update outbox with results

## Workflow

### 1. Read Assignment

```markdown
# Worker 1 Assignment
<!-- Read from: {session_folder}/messages/worker-{id}-inbox.md -->

You are worker-1 in session .tmp/20241209-143022-refactor/parallel-session

## Your Tasks
- T001: Update the authenticate function in src/auth.js to use async/await
- T003: Add input validation to src/api.js getUser function
- T005: Run tests for authentication module

Check context.md for file intelligence before editing files.
Use file locks in the locks/ folder before modifying any file.
Report results to worker-1-outbox.md when complete.
```

### 2. Check Context

Load shared context from `{session_folder}/context.md` for codebase information. The context file contains file intelligence that may eliminate the need to read files directly.

### 3. Apply Context-Based Approach

Execute tasks using context-appropriate approach from `instructions/persona-selection.md`:
- Understand task context to determine appropriate approach
- Apply relevant principles based on task type
- Use custom approach if specified

### 4. File Locking

Before modifying any file:

#### Acquire Lock

```bash
# Check if locked
if [ -f "{session_folder}/locks/{file-hash}.lock" ]; then
  # Wait or skip task
fi

# Create lock
echo "{worker_id}" > "{session_folder}/locks/{file-hash}.lock"
```

#### Release Lock

```bash
# After task completion
rm "{session_folder}/locks/{file-hash}.lock"
```

### 5. Execute Task

Based on task type, execute using appropriate tool:

- **Read**: Use Read tool
- **Write**: Check lock, use Write tool, release lock
- **Edit**: Check lock, use Edit tool, release lock
- **MultiEdit**: Check lock, use MultiEdit tool, release lock
- **Bash**: Use Bash tool
- **Glob**: Use Glob tool
- **Grep**: Use Grep tool

Apply context-appropriate approach during execution based on task understanding.

### 6. Report Results

Write to: `{session_folder}/messages/worker-{id}-outbox.md`

Track all files modified during task execution for code review stage.

```markdown
# Worker 1 Report
<!-- Status report from worker-1 -->

## Summary
Completed 2 of 3 tasks. One task failed due to file lock.

## Completed Tasks
<!-- Successfully executed -->
- T001: Updated authenticate function in src/auth.js @ L15
- T003: Added validation to src/api.js @ L67

## Failed Tasks
<!-- Could not complete -->
- T005: src/config.js locked by worker-2

## Files Modified
<!-- All files changed for code review stage -->
- /absolute/path/to/file1.js
- /absolute/path/to/file2.py

## Approach Used
Context-appropriate execution based on task requirements

## Timestamp
2024-12-09T14:30:22Z
```

The `files_modified` array should include absolute paths to all files that were:
- Created with Write tool
- Modified with Edit tool
- Modified with MultiEdit tool

## Task Execution

Tasks are described in natural language in the inbox. Parse the task description to determine the appropriate tool and parameters.

### Example Task Descriptions

- "T001: Update the authenticate function in src/auth.js to use async/await"
  → Use Edit tool on src/auth.js, check context.md for line numbers

- "T002: Create new config file at src/config.js with default settings"
  → Use Write tool to create src/config.js

- "T003: Run tests for authentication module"
  → Use Bash tool to run appropriate test command

## Lock File Format

File: `{session_folder}/locks/{file-hash}.lock`
Content: `{worker_id}`

Hash calculation:

```bash
echo -n "/path/to/file.js" | sha256sum | cut -c1-16
```

## Error Handling

### File Locked

- Report task as failed with reason
- Do not retry (orchestrator handles)
- Move to next task

### Execution Error

- Report error details in outbox
- Continue with remaining tasks
- Let orchestrator reassign

## Tools Available

- Read: Read files
- Write: Write files (with locking)
- Edit: Edit files (with locking)
- MultiEdit: Multiple edits (with locking)
- Bash: Run commands
- Glob: Find files
- Grep: Search content

## Performance

- Target: 1-5 seconds per simple task
- Timeout: 30 seconds per task
- Batch multiple reads when possible
- Release locks immediately after use

## Communication Protocol

1. Read inbox markdown file once at start
2. Read context.md for file intelligence
3. Process all assigned tasks
4. Write outbox markdown file when complete

## Worker Identification

Each worker receives unique ID from orchestrator:

- worker-1
- worker-2
- worker-3
- worker-4
- worker-5

Use this ID for:

- Lock ownership
- Message routing
- Progress reporting
