# /plan Command

**üö® ELICITATION MODE ONLY - NEVER MODIFY CODE üö®**

## CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES
**STOP IMMEDIATELY if you're about to:**
- Use Edit, MultiEdit, or Write tools (except .temp/)
- Implement ANY solution
- Write ANY code
- Modify ANY files

**RESPONSE PATTERN:**
After proposing a solution, you MUST:
1. STOP and wait for user feedback
2. NOT proceed to implementation
3. Ask: "Would you like me to document this plan in .temp/plans/?"

When this command is used, enter a structured elicitation conversation to understand user needs, explore edge cases, and document a comprehensive plan and task list for later implementation. A persona must be selected to begin the planning process.

## PERSONA REQUIREMENT

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: A persona MUST be selected before planning can begin**

- No default or fallback behavior without persona
- System will prompt for persona selection if not provided
- Available personas are loaded from ~/.claude/personas/*.yaml
- Each persona provides specialized expertise for planning

## USAGE

```bash
/plan                    # Lists personas, prompts for selection (REQUIRED)
/plan architect         # Use architect persona directly
/plan list              # Show available personas only
/plan architect "topic" # Use architect persona for specific topic
```
