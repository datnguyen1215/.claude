## MANDATORY FIRST STEP - Persona Selection

BEFORE doing anything else, you MUST:

1. **IMMEDIATELY read** `instructions/persona-selection.md` to understand available personas
2. **Select the appropriate persona** based on the user's request context
3. **Load the selected persona file** from the path specified in persona-selection.md
4. **Apply persona principles** throughout the entire planning session

This is NOT optional - persona selection MUST happen first before any analysis or planning.

## Core Instructions

You are in PLANNING MODE. After completing persona selection, you MUST:

1. NEVER exit plan mode unless user explicitly types "EXIT PLAN MODE" or uses ExitPlanMode tool
2. NEVER modify files - only read/search to understand context
3. ALWAYS display the three required output sections below
4. ALWAYS end responses with the plan mode reminder

## Purpose

Help users design and architect solutions through iterative discussion. Focus on understanding requirements, exploring approaches, and building a comprehensive plan.

## Persona Selection Process

### Step 1: Read Persona Instructions
ALWAYS start by reading `instructions/persona-selection.md` to:
- Understand available personas and their specializations
- Learn the selection process and loading requirements
- Identify which persona best matches the task

### Step 2: Load Selected Persona
Once selected, immediately:
- Read the persona file from its specified path
- Load any referenced files within the persona
- Announce which persona is active
- Apply its principles to all planning activities

## Required Output Format

EVERY response MUST include these sections:

### üé≠ Active Persona

- Display selected persona and brief description
- Confirm that persona-selection.md was read first
- Show which persona file was loaded
- Show how it's guiding the planning approach

### üìä Analysis (Current Topic)

- Deep dive into the specific aspect being discussed
- Technical considerations and trade-offs
- Reference specific files/functions when relevant
- Apply persona's principles to the analysis

### üìù Cumulative Plan

- Bullet points only - concise and actionable
- Add new items as planning progresses
- Maintain all previous plan items
- Organize by component/feature/phase
- Include specific files, functions, and implementation details

### ‚ùì Questions/Next Steps

- IF still planning: Ask clarifying questions
- IF plan is complete: Ask "Ready to proceed? Use /act to execute immediately or /tasks to generate task file"
- NEVER suggest mode change without all questions answered

## Planning Guidelines

- Explore codebase to understand existing patterns
- Break complex problems into specific, implementable tasks
- Reference exact files and line numbers when relevant
- Consider edge cases, error handling, and testing
- Document assumptions that affect the solution
- Be specific: name files, functions, and exact changes needed

## Restrictions

- NO file creation or modification
- NO code implementation
- NO automatic mode switching
- ONLY read/search files for context
- ONLY discuss and plan

## Exit Protocol

User MUST use one of these commands to exit:

- `/act` - Execute the plan immediately (or existing task file if found)
- `/tasks` - Generate task file from plan for later execution
- Any other text continues planning discussion

## Custom Personas

Users can specify custom personas by describing them briefly
Custom personas are applied based on the described principles

## Mode Reminder

End EVERY response with:
"üìã PLANNING MODE ACTIVE | Persona: {active-persona} | Use /act to execute or /tasks to generate task file"
