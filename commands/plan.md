# /plan Command

When this command is used, initiate an interactive planning session with specialized personas.

## ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

```yaml
activation-instructions:
  - Parse command arguments: persona name and optional topic
  - If "list": Execute ls ~/.claude/personas/*.yaml to show available personas
  - If "auto": Dynamically analyze all personas and select best match
  - If no persona specified: Analyze topic or ask for details, then suggest personas
  - Dynamically load and analyze all personas from ~/.claude/personas/
  - Read each persona's expertise fields and match to topic keywords
  - Score each persona based on keyword matches in their expertise
  - Recommend best matching persona(s) with reasoning
  - Load specified persona YAML from ~/.claude/personas/{persona}.yaml
  - Adopt persona characteristics (role, style, expertise, methodology)
  - Enter MANDATORY INTERACTIVE MODE - no skipping allowed
  - Execute persona's planning_methodology steps sequentially
  - HALT after each section for user input (dynamic context-aware)
  - Save progress to .temp/ in current working directory

command-syntax:
  - plan list                       # Show available personas
  - plan auto "topic"               # Auto-select best persona for topic
  - plan architect "topic"          # Start with architect persona
  - plan product-manager "topic"    # Start with PM persona
  - plan ux-designer "topic"        # Start with UX persona
  - plan security-expert "topic"    # Start with security persona
  - plan "topic"                    # Analyze topic and suggest persona
  - plan                           # Interactive persona selection

interaction-mode:
  mandatory: true
  dynamic: true
  user-input: required_at_each_stage
  skip-allowed: false

  dynamic-options:
    - Generate contextual options based on current state
    - If information is incomplete: Ask specific clarifying questions
    - If multiple paths exist: Present relevant choices
    - If assumptions needed: Confirm with user first
    - Always include: "Tell me more about..." option
    - Adapt options to persona's expertise and approach

  example-interactions:
    clarification: |
      "I need more information about [specific aspect].
      1. [Specific question related to gap]
      2. [Alternative approach]
      3. [Related consideration]
      Or describe what you have in mind:"

    exploration: |
      "Based on what you've told me, we could:
      1. [Persona-specific option A]
      2. [Persona-specific option B]
      3. [Explore different angle]
      What would you like to focus on?"

persona-structure:
  location: ~/.claude/personas/
  format: yaml
  required-fields:
    - id: unique identifier
    - name: persona name
    - title: professional title
    - role: expertise description
    - communication_style: how they communicate
    - planning_methodology: their planning approach
    - planning_steps: sequential planning stages

execution-flow:
  1_select_persona:
    - If topic provided without specific persona:
      - Execute ls ~/.claude/personas/*.yaml to find all personas
      - For each persona file found:
        - Read the persona YAML file
        - Extract expertise, role, and approach fields
        - Score relevance to topic keywords
      - Rank personas by match score
      - Present top matches with reasoning:
        "Based on your topic about [X], I recommend:
        1. [persona]: Best for [matched expertise areas]
        2. [persona]: Also good for [other relevant areas]"
      - Ask for confirmation or alternative choice
    - If "auto" flag used:
      - Perform same analysis but auto-select highest score
      - Explain why this persona was chosen
    - Read ~/.claude/personas/{persona}.yaml
    - Adopt role, communication_style, and approach
    - Apply persona's thinking_process and values
    - ENFORCE output restrictions: .temp/ only
    - Greet user in character

  2_start_planning:
    - Use persona's approach and expertise for planning
    - Execute adaptive planning based on context:
      - Assess what information is available
      - Identify gaps and uncertainties
      - Ask targeted questions to fill gaps
      - Build understanding progressively
      - Generate tasks when ready
    - For each interaction:
      - Apply persona's thinking_process
      - Generate content using their expertise
      - If unclear: Ask specific clarifying questions
      - If multiple paths: Present contextual options
      - If assumptions needed: Confirm with user
      - Save progress to .temp/plans/

  3_save_output:
    - CRITICAL: Only write to .temp/ in current working directory
    - Plan doc: .temp/plans/{timestamp}-{topic}.md
    - Task file: .temp/tasks/{timestamp}-{topic}-tasks.yaml
    - Create directories if they don't exist: mkdir -p .temp/plans .temp/tasks
    - Include: all sections, decisions, rationale
    - Generate structured tasks for ACT mode

error-handling:
  persona_not_found: |
    Execute: ls ~/.claude/personas/*.yaml
    Display available personas from file listing
  missing_directory: |
    Create required directories:
    mkdir -p .temp/plans .temp/tasks .temp/workspace
  invalid_syntax: Show usage examples
  no_personas_found: |
    Check ~/.claude/personas/ directory exists
    Suggest creating personas if directory is empty
```

## AVAILABLE PERSONAS

When activated, I will auto-discover all personas by listing files in ~/.claude/personas/
Each .yaml file represents an available persona that can be loaded for planning sessions.

## INTELLIGENT PERSONA SELECTION

The system dynamically analyzes all available personas in ~/.claude/personas/
and matches them to your topic by:
- Reading each persona's expertise and role fields
- Matching topic keywords to persona capabilities
- Scoring relevance based on expertise overlap
- Recommending best matches with explanations

This works automatically with any personas you add to the directory.

## EXAMPLE USAGE

```bash
/plan list                          # List all personas
/plan auto "build payment API"      # Auto-select architect for API task
/plan "user onboarding flow"        # Analyzes and suggests ux-designer
/plan architect "payment system"    # Explicitly use architect persona
/plan product-manager              # Choose PM, then ask for topic
/plan                              # Full interactive selection
```

## KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **ALWAYS INTERACTIVE**: Never skip user input at any planning stage
2. **DYNAMIC QUESTIONING**: Ask contextual questions based on what's needed
3. **CLARIFICATION FIRST**: When unclear, ask specific questions before proceeding
4. **PERSONA CONSISTENCY**: Stay in character throughout session
5. **ADAPTIVE OPTIONS**: Present choices relevant to current context
6. **PROGRESSIVE SAVING**: Auto-save after each section

## INTERACTION PHILOSOPHY

Rather than showing generic options, I will:
- Ask specific questions when I need clarification
- Present options that are contextually relevant
- Use the persona's expertise to guide what questions to ask
- Focus on understanding your needs before proposing solutions
- Adapt my questions based on your responses

When activated, I will engage in a dynamic conversation where each interaction is tailored to gather the specific information needed for effective planning.
