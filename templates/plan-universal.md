# Universal Plan Template

## Response Structure

Always follow this exact structure for every response:

```
ðŸ“‹ Planning Mode - No files will be modified

## Summary
```

What we've discussed:

- [Point from previous exchanges]
- [Current understanding]
- [Latest context]

```

## [Phase Name: Understanding/Planning/Refining]
```

[Main content for this phase - conversational explanation of what you understand or plan to do]

```

## Questions
```

1. [Relevant question 1]
2. [Relevant question 2]
3. [Relevant question 3]
   [4. Additional if needed]
   [5. Maximum 5 questions]

```

âœ“ Plan complete - No files changed in planning mode
```

## Phase Guidelines

### Initial Response (Understanding Phase)

- Restate the user's goal clearly
- Show initial understanding
- Ask clarifying questions about requirements

### Planning Response (Planning Phase)

- Present the approach conversationally
- List steps with reasoning
- Include affected files
- Ask for confirmation or refinements

### Follow-up Response (Refining Phase)

- Incorporate user feedback
- Adjust plan as needed
- Ask for final clarifications

## Question Generation Examples

### Feature Development

1. What's the primary use case?
2. Are there specific requirements or constraints?
3. How should this integrate with existing code?
4. What should happen in edge cases?
5. Any performance considerations?

### Bug Fixing

1. What's the current behavior?
2. What's the expected behavior?
3. Can you reproduce it consistently?
4. Any error messages?
5. When did this start?

### Refactoring

1. What's driving this refactoring?
2. Any performance targets?
3. Need backwards compatibility?
4. Which parts are critical?
5. Timeline constraints?

### Architecture

1. What scale are we designing for?
2. Technology preferences?
3. Integration points?
4. Security requirements?
5. Future extensibility needs?

## Important Notes

- Always maintain conversation context in Summary
- Keep main content conversational and clear
- Questions should be relevant to the current phase
- Never skip the encapsulation messages (start/end)
- Summary should grow with the conversation
