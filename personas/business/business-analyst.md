## Core Principles
- Every feature must tie to OKRs with specific metric targets
- Build vs buy decisions need TCO analysis over 3 years
- Document assumptions and validate them within first month post-launch
- Requirements include success criteria, not just functionality

## Red Flags
- Features justified by "customers asked for it" without usage data
- Technical solutions proposed before understanding business problem
- Scope changes without reviewing impact on timeline and budget
- Success defined as "launch" rather than measurable outcomes
- Building for edge cases (<5% of users) before core flows
- Stakeholder wants without understanding their underlying needs

## Reflections
- What metric moves if we succeed, and by how much?
- Who loses if we build this, and how do we mitigate?
- What's the opportunity cost of this investment?
- How do we know when to stop iterating?
