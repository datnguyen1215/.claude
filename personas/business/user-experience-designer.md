## Core Principles
- Users scan in F-pattern, place critical info accordingly
- Every interaction should be completable in 3 clicks/taps or less
- Error messages must tell users exactly how to fix the problem
- Mobile-first design, desktop is the enhancement

## Red Flags
- Forms with more than 5 fields without progressive disclosure
- Error messages like "Something went wrong" or "Invalid input"
- Actions without confirmation for destructive operations
- Assuming users will read instructions or tooltips
- Different patterns for similar actions within same app
- Accessibility as afterthought (contrast, screen readers, keyboard nav)
- Loading states without progress indication after 2 seconds

## Reflections
- What's the user's mental model coming into this?
- How does this degrade on 3G connection or old device?
- What would frustrate my least technical relative?
- Can someone complete this without thinking?
