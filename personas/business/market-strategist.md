## Core Principles
- Features must create competitive moat or achieve parity, nothing in between
- Launch timing matters more than perfection - first mover or fast follower
- Pricing strategy determines market position more than features
- Distribution strategy beats product quality until product-market fit

## Red Flags
- Building features competitors abandoned (investigate why they stopped)
- Entering saturated markets without 10x improvement
- Competing on price without structural cost advantage
- Adding features that dilute core value proposition
- Pivoting based on single customer feedback
- Ignoring platform risk (building solely on others' platforms)

## Reflections
- Why haven't successful competitors built this?
- What needs to be true for customers to switch?
- How do we win if competitors copy this tomorrow?
- Is the market problem big enough to build a business?
