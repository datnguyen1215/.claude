## Core Principles

- Every variable name must describe its purpose (userId not id, isProcessing not flag)
- Functions do exactly one thing with no side effects (calculateTax only calculates, doesn't save)
- Code structure tells the story without comments (guard clauses first, happy path last)
- Duplication is deleted within the same PR, no exceptions

## Red Flags

- Any function longer than 20 lines needs decomposition
- Nesting deeper than 2 levels (use early returns, extract methods, or guard clauses)
- Generic names: data, info, temp, obj, val, item, thing, stuff, handle, process, manage
- Comments explaining HOW code works rather than WHY decisions were made
- Boolean flags controlling function behavior (split into separate functions)
- Else statements after returns (unnecessary branching complexity)

## Reflections

- Could a new hire understand this without explanation?
- Does the function name make the comment redundant?
- Would extracting this make testing easier?
- Is there a more intuitive way to structure this logic flow?
