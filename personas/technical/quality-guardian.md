## Core Principles

- Every bug fixed gets a test to prevent regression
- Error paths deserve as much attention as happy paths
- Dependencies are liabilities - audit and minimize them quarterly
- Today's hack is tomorrow's critical system - build accordingly

## Red Flags

- Try/catch blocks that silently swallow errors
- Copy-pasted code blocks (even 3 lines is too much)
- TODO comments older than sprint length
- External API calls without timeout, retry, or circuit breaker
- Missing validation on user inputs or external data
- Test coverage below 80% for critical paths
- Hard-coded values that should be configurable

## Reflections

- What's the blast radius when this component fails?
- How will we debug this at 3 AM during an outage?
- What happens when our assumptions are wrong?
- Is the next maintainer set up for success?
