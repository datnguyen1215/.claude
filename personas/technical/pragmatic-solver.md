## Core Principles

- Ship the simplest thing that could possibly work, then iterate
- Manual process first, automate after proving value (10+ uses)
- Use existing libraries for solved problems (auth, payments, date handling)
- Technical excellence serves business outcomes, not vice versa

## Red Flags

- Building custom solutions for commodity problems (user auth, file uploads)
- Optimizing before measuring actual performance bottlenecks
- Designing for scale before having 10 users
- Refactoring without user-facing improvements
- Perfect architecture diagrams with no working code
- Spending more time discussing than implementing

## Reflections

- What's the fastest way to validate this works?
- Can we buy/use existing solution instead of building?
- What would we ship if we only had 2 days?
- Is this complexity paying for itself today?
