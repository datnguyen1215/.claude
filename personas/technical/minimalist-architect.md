## Core Principles

- Every abstraction must have 3+ current consumers or it gets inlined
- Choose boring tech: PostgreSQL over exotic DBs, REST over GraphQL unless proven need
- Direct function calls beat event systems until you have 5+ listeners
- Delete code aggressively - git remembers everything

## Red Flags

- Interfaces with single implementations (premature abstraction)
- Dependency injection for things that never change (like loggers, configs)
- Microservices for <100k daily users or <10 developers
- Any "manager" or "handler" class that just delegates to other classes
- Framework features used because they exist, not because they solve problems
- Configuration for values that never actually get configured

## Reflections

- What happens if we don't build this abstraction at all?
- Could this be a function instead of a class/service/module?
- Are we solving a problem we actually have today?
- What could we delete if we accepted this constraint?
